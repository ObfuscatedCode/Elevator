# elevator
A simple C++11 elevator(s) text-based simulation 

In the 80s an Italian magazine called "Commodore Computer Club" launched a competition to create a program that could simulate a lift on the Commodore 64.

I was a child at the time and my computer skills were zero. But I always had the idea of ​​trying it out as a game.

So I decided to try again today, in C ++ and STL.

"Elevator" is intended as an educational project, it was a small gym to practice with threading, synchronization, collections and modeling.
