# elevator
A simple C++11 elevator(s) text-based simulation 

In the 80s an italian magazine called "Commodore Computer Club" launched a competition to create a program that could simulate an elevator on the Commodore 64.

I was a child at the time and my computer skills were zero, but I always had the idea of trying it out as a game, so I decided to try again today with C ++ and STL.

"Elevator" is intended as an educational project, it was a small gym to practice with threading, synchronization, collections and modeling.
