# elevator
A simple C++11 elevator(s) text-based simulation 
[Windows/Linux multiplatform project]

In the 80s an italian magazine called "Commodore Computer Club" launched a competition to create a program that could simulate an elevator on the Commodore 64. I was a child at the time and my computer skills were zero, but I always had the idea of trying it out as a game, so I decided to try again today with C ++ and STL. 

The simulated model requires the user to call the elevator by simply selecting the floor he wants to go to. The "management" receives the call and assigns it to the most appropriate elevator. This model is the one that allows more optimizations than traditional internal choice elevator and is exactly what is installed in the building where I work.

"Elevator" is intended as an educational project, it was a small gym to practice with threading, synchronization, collections and modeling.
